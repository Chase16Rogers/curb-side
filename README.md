# Welcome to Curb-Side

## In a world gripped by the worst pandemic any one alive has seen, many countries found it necessary to enforce strict quarantine policies. These policies not only made small businesses struggle to stay afloat, thousands found themselves no longer able to break even and were forced to close. If only there was an application that could "host" these businesses allowing them to make sales to customers over the internet, then finish the transaction at their curb.

## That's exactly what we set out to achieve. Over a little less than two weeks, a group of four students from Boise CodeWorks (Shiwani Rana, Parker Burkett, Ryan Davis, and Chase Rogers) were forced to challenge and expand our understanding of programming while constantly pair programming and working in an Agile environment based around SCRUM principles.

## We created our front-end using Vue, Bootstrap, SCSS, and the font-awesome library, our back-end was developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDb, among a number of other technologies that we use, for example, as middleware. We wrote our server being mindful of Restful conventions, which made writing the client that much easier. We used Auth0 on both the client and server to create a secure login. We were able to incorporate, at least in a small way, the Google Maps Api, Mongoose geolocation, and even used local storage to increase the persistance of our shopping cart.

## We used the figma platform to design our UI, lucidchart to plan out our data relationships, and Google Docs to keep track of our routes.

## This challenge was a fun way for us to grow as software developers, and show off where we are in our education.
