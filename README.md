# Curb-Syde

#### This application addresses small businesses who need to facilitate communications for customers ordering items to pick up curbside. Conducting curbside pickup over the phone is ineffective and costly, as each arriving customer calls in just to let a business know they've arrived. Curb-Syde seeks to facilitate the entire customer interaction, from placing an order to physically picking up the order. 

## Technologies used
### Front end
* ####Vue.js

#### We created our front-end using Vue, Bootstrap, SCSS, and the font-awesome library, our back-end was developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDb, among a number of other technologies that we use, for example, as middleware. We wrote our server being mindful of Restful conventions, which made writing the client that much easier. We used Auth0 on both the client and server to create a secure login. We were able to incorporate, at least in a small way, the Google Maps Api, Mongoose geolocation, sockets for a more dynamic application, and we even used local storage to increase the persistance of our shopping cart.

#### We used the figma platform to design our UI, lucidchart to plan out our data relationships, and Google Docs to keep track of our routes.

#### This challenge was a fun way for us to grow as software developers, and show off where we are in our education.
